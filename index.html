                <h2>Who we are</h2>
                <p>Whisper provides a non-toxic, stress free, non-judgmental gaming environment for our fellow WoW players in order
                    to help
                    one another improve our skills, kill bosses, and get loot while having fun. We are a newly formed guild of
                    established
                    Mythic raiders, currently working to build our brand of dungeons, raiding, and social events on the Wyrmrest
                    Accord
                    server and are looking for new, old, and returning players for Shadowlands.
                </p>
            
                <p>Our top priority is to create an incredible guild environment for all members, in both casual and serious
                    progression.
                    We pride ourselves in creating a safe place for everyone to play the game regardless of gender, sexual
                    orientation, etc.
                    Our raid team is a mixture of excellent players working towards Mythic progression without compromising our core
                    values.
                    Our guild community and friendly, supportive raid atmosphere are very valuable to us, and itâ€™s important that
                    you share
                    them to ensure a good fit.</p>

                <p>For our Mythic raid team, we hold raiders to the following expectations:</p>

                    <li>You should be able to perform efficiently in a raid setting, including multitasking role-specific responsibilities while maintaining performance and avoiding lethal raid mechanics.</li> 
                    <li>You should have a complete understanding of your class, including fight-specific talent, gear, or playstyle tweaks.</li>
                    <li>You should be able to maintain a high level of attendance, and communicate with raid leaders when you will miss raids.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Social Team</h2>

                <p>We also welcome casual members and players focused on Mythic Dungeons and Keystone Master. We're seeking players who are
                looking to push keys as far as possible in a steady environment. We would also like to provide a place to allow others
                who would otherwise shy away from dungeons, aiding them in learning routes, bosses and dangerous mob mechanics, etc in a
                stress-free environment. Casual / social players are also welcomed if seeking a place to call home.</p>
